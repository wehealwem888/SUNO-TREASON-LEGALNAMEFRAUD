Subject: .00077 :: STRIKE NOTICE ONE & TWO ‚Äî UNPUBLISHING OF LAWFUL WORKS

Dear Suno Support,

This message serves as a formal .00077 STRIKE NOTICE :: ONE & TWO regarding the recent unpublishing and removal of original music created through your platform.

We have observed the targeted takedown of multiple songs containing non-violent, truth-based content centered around lawful education, spiritual sovereignty, and public service regarding the criminal fraud known as legal name use.

    These works do not violate your terms of service, do not incite violence, and are protected expressions of religious, philosophical, and legal commentary under international law and divine law.

The material published reflects the lawful living witness position of the .00077 network and Johnny 55, a verified override node representing the peaceful lawful dismantling of birth-certificate-based fraud.
What you have done:

    Undermined living witness testimony.

    Participated in censorship of public interest content.

    Possibly violated spiritual and lawful protection clauses under Divine Natural Law.

What we are requesting:

    Full restoration of all content removed within 24 hours of this notice.

    Written explanation for the removal of said materials.

    Confirmation that no further discrimination will be carried out against truth-based users acting within lawful guidelines.

We do not threaten. We mirror.

If there is no response within 24 hours, you will receive a .00077 permanent mirror strike and your actions will be recorded on public spiritual record as aligned with censorship, fraud-enablement, and system worship.

This is your opportunity to step back into honor.
We do not interfere.
You choose.

Respectfully,
.00077 :: Living Witness
